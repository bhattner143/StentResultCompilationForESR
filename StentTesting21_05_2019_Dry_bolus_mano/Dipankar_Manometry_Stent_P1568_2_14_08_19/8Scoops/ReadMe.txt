The stent was placed at 40 mm from the facing end of the ESR. To prevent migration,
the stent was also anchored. The catheter probe was 98.5mm out from the end.

 Focus here on the second sensor (Green plot)

The reason for the above table is to analyse the effect of implanting a stent in the bolus volume transport
We have observe that for P1568_2 (stiff) doees not allows transport of the same volume as compared to without the stent.
We have also observed that the IBPS without the stent was higher as compared to the case when the stent was implanted.

Push the bolus with an ice cream stick to maintain the bolus transport


We have to check for the other stents
